# **Success is Waiting On You**

### **Have you been getting in your own way lately?**

I'm willing to bet you dollars to donuts that at some point today you're going to think about your success. In whatever area you choose or consider important, there is going to be a moment where it hits you. In that moment, you're going to assess your level of accomplishment or achievement in that area. A fair amount of self-reflection is important and beneficial, as long as you don't let yourself get too caught up on the idea of failure.

If you have not experienced whatever level of success that you are looking for, then you should give your attention to feedback, NOT failure. However, since it is all too easy to tumble into the negative connotations and assumptions about failure, let's discuss the reasons why you are not successful so you can see that the road and therefore the journey continues ahead.

## **You don't have a goal.**

This is the easiest one to catch for just about anybody. How do you expect to feel like a success or call yourself that in the future if you have no goals? You know, the kind of goals that you've written down and declared to the universe. You absolutely must define for yourself what you want. Use your mind to visualize the success that you want for yourself. What does_the successful you_do? Who does_the successful you_know? Who wants to get to know_the successful you_? How can_the successful you_impact the world? The clearer your vision is and the more upfront you are about what you expect from yourself, the better your goal is.

By now you've probably heard about SMART goals- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Revisable, and Time-Sensitive. Don't get stuck on acronyms but remember that effort goes into setting goals, and DEFINITELY into accomplishing them. The more you can answer each question implied in the SMART acronym, the stronger your goal will be as you learn, grow, and do more. Just remember that a goal is different from a state of mind--- a state of mind can be attained immediately like happiness or even confidence. A goal like success or competence obviously takes more time to experience and cannot be had just because you want it. If you want it, you've got to work for it.

## **You don't have a plan.**

A goal and a plan go hand in hand, and one should not be had without the other. Just because you have a great goal doesn't amount to much if you haven't planned it out. Planning is a skill that many have naturally, but the rest of us have to develop this everyday. A plan isn't just the steps, it's the strategy too. If you want to get in shape, you know the steps are to hit the gym, eat right, and get plenty rest, but your strategy can be vastly different from anyone else's. How often will you work out? What foods will you add to or remove from your diet? Your plan needs to be as dynamic as you are yourself and encompass pretty much every facet of how you plan to attack your goal.

Get a planner. Use post-it notes. Get a dreamboard. A big part of your plan should be to confront your goal constantly to keep in touch with it. The thing about goals is they can be easily forgotten due to all the distractions. Things that you want in the future can get blocked by things that you have to do now. Watch to my video on How to Plan the Benjamin Franklin Way for more on how you can take care of the urgent and important things that arise in your life while keeping an eye on the bigger picture.

## **You don't use your awareness.**

Even after you've set a goal and launched your diabolical plan to get there by any means necessary, you have to be aware of your universe. There will always be obstacles to any endeavor. Things get in the way but if you use your awareness all the time, you'll develop better senses as well as prepare to avoid them. Even if you can't avoid a certain obstacle or challenge, it is better to be aware than to get blindsided by something on your road to success. You wouldn't drive your car and not pay attention to road ahead would you? Steering your life blindly can be just as dangerous (maybe even more).

Sharpen your awareness. Take a moment and try to remember as many details as you can about something you took for granted before. The lady you last saw who caught your eye--- what color was she wearing? How did she do her hair that day? If you were close enough to smell her fragrance, what came to mind? Use your senses more by considering the importance of the information that that usually passes through your mind unnoticed. Grow your intellect through an increased awareness of yourself and your surroundings.

## **You aren't flexible enough.**

How can you expect to reach the ultimate goal if you can't maneuver through different challenges? Increasing your awareness is one step, but it is nothing to be aware of something that is coming at you if you do not or cannot respond accordingly. Flexibility is how well you can adjust and adapt to a situation without breaking. As life gets tougher, you go through things that you didn't foresee. If you allow those things to deter you, distract you, or hurt you, then you may lose sight of the goal you set. You have to find a way to move around things and get past them. 

There are no great people without great struggle. There are so many legends of history and even more quotes to prove that point. It's actually a good thing to know that you can take the hard times and turn them into good stories. When I was still in school I proclaimed the statement "I want to be great" and although that statement itself may not be very clear, I was clear on what that meant to me at the time. It seemed like from that moment forward I was confronted with the most amazing life changes, hurdles, and stumbling blocks. I even went through depression for a few years all because I didn't know how to be flexible. Now, my flexibility proves to me that I have faith in myself, my efforts, and my future. Flexibility can be the commitment that makes your dreams come true because less will knock you off your game if you know how to stay on track.

## **You don't own it.**

This makes me think of the halftime locker room scene in Remember the Titans where the team stood up for themselves even though they had to deal with racism, corrupt referees, and a city that was divided on who should lead their home team. By saying "it's our time!" they took ownership of the moment and put everything they had into the second half. You may win today, you may lose today, but when you own it, you're not leaving your greatness up to chance. You're not willing to find out if the world will hand it to you. You take life by the reigns and ride it until it becomes yours. Never underestimate that the world will bend to the one with the strongest conviction.

Your self confidence is a large part of success. Why do you think some people can be successful at one thing then go on to something else and still excel?  It's because they took ownership of their success, long before they actually realized it. This is also where Beginner's Luck comes from sometimes. A person who doesn't think it's not theirs to own can reach amazing levels just by putting in an effort. Now just imagine what one could do with their effort by actually knowing it was theirs for the taking. Anything that you want bad enough should make you want to have it now, so hold yourself to the standard of someone who already has it.
